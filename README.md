# Virtual Herbal Garden

Welcome to the Virtual Herbal Garden project! This web application is designed to provide an interactive, multimedia-rich experience where users can explore a collection of plants, learn about their medicinal uses, scientific details, and enjoy a virtual garden tour. This project combines 3D models, plant data, videos, and images to bring the beauty and knowledge of plants to life.

## Features

- **Plant Catalog**: A searchable catalog of various plants with images, scientific names, descriptions, and medicinal uses.
- **Plant Detail Pages**: View detailed information about each plant, including scientific names, family, medicinal uses, and additional facts.
- **Multimedia Integration**: Each plant detail page includes an image, video (where available), and a description.
- **Virtual Garden Tour**: Explore the garden in a virtual space, featuring 3D models of plants.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily find plants by name, category, or specific characteristics.
- **Social Features**: Users can interact, share their experiences, and comment on plant information.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React for the user interface
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Axios for API calls
  - React Router for navigation

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js with Express (for serving plant data via API)
  - MongoDB (or any other database for plant data storage)

- **Additional Libraries**:
  - React 3D model integration for displaying plants in a 3D space
  - External APIs for fetching plant information (e.g., Trefle API)

## Getting Started

To get started with the development of the Virtual Herbal Garden, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
- A running backend server (local or hosted) to serve plant data.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-herbal-garden.git
   cd virtual-herbal-garden
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the frontend development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - This will start the React development server and open the application in your browser (usually on `http://localhost:3000`).

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the backend repository** (if you have a separate repo for the backend):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-herbal-garden-backend.git
   cd virtual-herbal-garden-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - The backend server will be running (usually on `http://localhost:5000`).

### API Configuration

Ensure that the API URL in the frontend (e.g., `https://api.example.com/plants/${id}`) matches the endpoint of your running backend server or public plant API.

## Usage

- **Homepage**: Displays the welcome message and features of the Virtual Herbal Garden.
- **Plant Catalog**: Users can search for and view a list of plants.
- **Plant Detail Page**: Clicking on any plant from the catalog will show detailed information about it, including images, videos, medicinal uses, and more.
- **Virtual Garden Tour**: Users can explore the plants in a virtual 3D garden.
